    "text": "Up until now, we’ve been creating programs that we run locally on our system, but often times when we interact with something on a computer, we do so thanks to something that someone else has made that we’ve acquired through the internet. Now, by making a website using HTML and CSS, we’ll do the same (in theory, anyway, since we won’t be publicly hosting our website, but you could if you wanted to). We’ll also put our code onto a GitHub repository so that anyone can play with it freely.\nIn this post, I’m going to create a simple website that gives the user the opportunity to send messages under a certain name or handle and will then be able to view such messages in a different page. The skeleton of the website will be designed via HTML templates, but we’ll be using a framework called Flask which allows us to write Python code specifically for our website, allowing us to incorporate more advanced techniques, including a SQL database which will contain users’ stored messages. Finally, we’ll also dabble a bit into CSS, which we can use to customize the look of our website, making it look like the popular messaging app Discord.\n\n\nWhile I provide a tutorial to create everything from scratch, you are free to download my files for the project and experiment with them however you like:\nhttps://github.com/torwar02/hw3\nEverything necessary is in the primary folder called flask-project"

    "text": "Creating a Flask Project\nOnce you have Flask installed, it’s time to actually create a project. We first need to set something up ourselves–make a folder, and give it an appropriate name (mine is simply called flask-project as it is unambiguous inside of my blog files), and using a text editor of your choice, create a new Python file, also giving it a sensible name (app.py). Then, in your command line, change the current directory to your project folder (using\ncd\nand the appropriate folder name) and run the following command:\nexport FLASK_APP=app.py\nThis lets Flask know that app.py is the sort of ‘master file’ that your web app is going to be based on. Otherwise, it wouldn’t know what to do! But we can’t actually run our website yet as we need to set up a few things in our file before we can even view anything. Inside of app.py, you should have the following:\nimport sqlite3\nimport pandas as pd\n\nfrom flask import Flask, g, render_template, request\nfrom flask import redirect, url_for\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\nThe import statements are nothing crazy, although it’s important to note that there are a lot of things that we have to retrieve from Flask itself, including Flask, which is necessary for making our website run, and render_template, without which we would not be able to view HTML files!\nFinally, the line app = Flask(__name__) is what actually creates the file into something that Flask can interact with. This is essentially the skeleton of the website.\nAt this point, we can actually get our website to work with the command\nflask run\nThough we won’t see our website because we haven’t put anything on it yet."

Below is a screenshot provided from the PIC 16B blog as an example:\n\n\n\nimage.png\n\n\n\n\nDatabase Creation\nWe’re going to eventually want the user to be able to view past messages, but to do so, we’re going to have to store existing ones somehow. We will do this by creating a function within app.py that allows us to create and manipulate a SQL database (which is why earlier we imported sqlite3), which will later be retrieved by the website.\n\n\nMessage Viewing\nFinally, we’re going to want to create an additional page so that users can look at previous messages that have been set. Per the specifications of this assignment, we’re going to want to display five randomly chosen messages out of the existing bank. We’ll have to make not only a new HTML page but also a function that allows us to retrieve the messages from the database.\nWith that overview out of the way, let’s get started!"

GET is the state of the page when we arrive on the page. render_template is what allows us to take another HTML file and display it on the page, so we’re going to have to make a template called submit.html. If the method is post, we’re going to call a function called insert_message that will allow us to put messages on the message board, so we need to write that function as well. There’s a lot that we have to do to make it work! Let’s start with the Python functions, because otherwise we won’t be able to even display anything on our site."

To do this, we’ll make a function called get_message_db().\nHere’s the function:\ndef get_message_db(): #create/access database\n    try:\n        return g.message_db #gets datbase from `g` object\n    except: #should only go through here once\n        g.message_db = sqlite3.connect(\"messages_db.sqlite\") #makes database\n        cursor = g.message_db.cursor()\n        cmd = \"\"\"\n        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS messages(\n        handle TEXT,\n        message TEXT\n        );\n        \"\"\" #creates table\n        cursor.execute(cmd)\n        cursor.close()\n        return g.message_db #then returns datbaase\nWe do this with try and except statements because we would get an error if the database doesn’t exist. Most of this should be review from the Week 1 post, including the use of sqlite3.connect to make and then connect to a database, which we call messages_db. Our SQL query creates a table called messages using the CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS command. We specify the name of each column (handle and message) as well as the data type (TEXT). We execute the command, close the cursor, and send back the database.\nThe only thing here that’s completely new is g, which is an attribute of app, that is, the file itself which comes with Flask. I am not well-versed enough in Flask to give an excellent explanation, but see this StackOverflow post for more info:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/30514749/what-is-the-g-object-in-this-flask-code\nEssentially, it’s a sort of global object in which we can store whatever we want while the app is running. This is important since it sort of lets us make global variables for any of the functions we create, which is why we decide to make our database equivalent to an attribute of g called message_db. Just note that this didn’t work (at least for me) until I imported g from Flask (which I had you do at the beginning)."

We’ll be grabbing user-inputted variables called message and handle (which will be part of the HTML code) and store them in the function. We then connect to the database using get_message_db(), create a one-row data frame called info containing the handle and the message, and append it onto the messages table in the database (once again, review Homework 1 post for details on the to_sql method from Pandas). Then, we commit the changes, lose the connection, and send back the handle and messages."

We’ll walk through the major parts, but note that I don’t know a lot of the fine details regarding HTML–it’s important to keep in mind that by working with Python, Flask, CSS, and HTML, we’re using many different tools, and it’s unrealistic to be able to master all of them in a short period of time. I have referred to documentation when I was stuck, and I encourage you to do the same.\nFirstly we write &lt;!doctype html&gt; to signal that this is an HTML document. The second statement connects it to the file that we’ll look at later which incorporates our CSS settings.\n\n&lt;title&gt; and &lt;nav&gt;\nFirst we start with a title. This refers to the text that appears on the tab of your web browser. Note that the content of each tag is demarcated by &lt;tag&gt; and &lt;/tag&gt;. A &lt;nav&gt; tag contains links to other parts of the page–we make this so that we can link the submission and viewing pages. First, we put some title text in &lt;h1&gt;, which stands for “heading 1” (bigger text, you’ve seen it on this blog!). Then, we make a &lt;ul&gt; or unordered list that has our links. Each element of a list is an li, and in each li we put the link to our other pages. This should look familiar from the webscraping tutorial–links are &lt;a&gt;. The only thing that’s new for us is the link itself, which is \"{{ url_for('submit') }}\"–we saw this earlier when using redirect–which refers to the URL governed by the submit function. We do the same for view. Then, we close out the list and navegation.\n\n\n&lt;img&gt;\nNow, I want to place images on either side to pretend that we’re on Discord. I took screenshots from a Discord server and uploaded them onto Discord itself since I frequently use it to store image links. I couldn’t get this to work by storing the images locally, otherwise I would have. Each &lt;img&gt; is made of various attributes: src tells us where to get it from (in our case, a URL), whereas height and width control the dimensions. style can be used to control where the image is placed on the page. I want them to look like sidebars, so I set the position to fixed and specify how many pixels from the page’s top, left, or right I want the image. This site was very helpful:\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp\n\n\n&lt;section&gt;\nWe use this tag to create concrete sections of a document. For base.html, there really shouldn’t be much here, since all we want to be constant is the navigation and images. Note that we can give it a class type of content , and inside, we use syntax from Jinja, which helps us code certain Python functionalities into HTML pages: we enclose these statements with a curly brace and percent sign, and inside, we put instructions. Here we create header and content blocks. In this case, they’re just markers–when we reference base.html in our other templates, we can specify what we want to put in here. base.html just provides a framework."

Essentially, we want to create a tag of type &lt;form&gt; which allows for user input on the site. We specify that it has a method called post–the same post as we saw in the arguments of submit(). The method on the page when we first arrive is get (not listed), but it will be updated to post once the user interacts with the text box, We create labels for the two text boxes (&lt;label&gt;) which we specify are for two variables called handle and message–the two things we wanted to place in messages_db.sqlite. We then create two different tags of type &lt;input&gt; which are the text boxes for the above variables, and finally, a submission button which we get as specifying the type for &lt;input&gt; as submit. Then, we end the form.\n\nrender_template()\nBack in the body for submit() in app.py, we see that we call the function render_template() on submit.html. This causes the template we’ve made above to be displayed and prompts the user for input, setting the method to post. Notice that this submission triggers the body of the else part of the conditional statement, which calls insert_message() on request (recall that request refers to what’s available on the current page). Recall that insert_message() starts as such:\ndef insert_message(request):\n    message = request.form['message']\n    handle = request.form['handle']\nIn other words, we grab the message and handle variables from the form of submit.html. This is how we are able to get Python to interact with the website through Flask in order to store the messages!\nAt the end of the else statement, we render the page once again but with sec set to True. We are allowed to input parameters into our function so long as they correspond with Jinja syntax. Returning to submit.html, we see that we have a statement {% if sec == True %}, which corresponds to such a variable. When the condition is satisfied, we create a line break &lt;br&gt; and display a message saying Message sent, after which we close the conditional statement and the block in general. Here’s what the website looks like when the user is submitting a message!\nThis image shows a user typing a message into the message form:\n\n\n\nImage 3\n\n\nThis one shows the submission message:\n\n\n\nImage 4"

Finally, LIMIT specifies the number of rows we want back hence, n.\nWe then use the read_sql_query command from pandas alongside the database connection created by using get_message_db, we close the connection, and then we return the rows that we get back.

Using a for loop, we add the handle and message as a tuple into the list by using the .iloc method to fetch what’s in each row.\nThen, we return render_template on view.html with an argument called message_tuples set equal to, well, message_tuples, which will be a variable that we place inside of the Jinja syntax."

In the header block, we place a title with the text #general (as is common on Discord servers).\nThen in the content block, we create a for loop in Jinja in order to print out precisely the messages that we had placed as tuples in message_tuples in view() from app.py. This loop first prints out the handle (which is the element at the 0th index) as an &lt;h4&gt; (header 4) while the actual message is simply kept as a paragraph (~normal text) &lt;p&gt;. This has the effect of highlighting the name in larger text, creating a slight break, and then putting the message in smaller text, which is more reminiscent of Discord’s actual appearance. Then, we place a line break after each message so that they aren’t directly on top of each other, and then we end the for loop and block.\nHere’s an image showing the view page with the message we sent earlier:\n\n\n\nImage 5"

These were largely copied from a CSS markup example that was given to us. Please visit the following website and the section on “Margin - Shorthand Property” for a detailed explanation https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_margin.asp – essentially, the first number refers to the amount of space given from the top and the second refers to the space from the right. rem is a unit that takes into account font sizes: https://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-and-using-rem-units-in-css/\nI set some of these settings to what they are because otherwise the page wouldn’t look right–it’s not common for a lot of trial and error to be necessary for this sort of process.\n\n\nOther Specifications\nThere are a few other CSS settings that I’ve tweaked:\na {\n    color: CornflowerBlue;\n}\n\n\nnav ul  {\n    display: flex;\n    list-style: none;\n    margin: 0;\n    padding: 0;\n}\n\nnav ul li a {\n    display: block;\n    padding: 1rem;\n}\nThe template I got this from set the link (that is, a) color to cornflower blue, which I really like. We also specify the settings for the unordered list &lt;ul&gt; and the list item links &lt;li&gt; in base.html. The settings in nav ul I also took from the template that we had, but I like how they look– display: none makes it so that they’re side-by-side, list-style: none removes bullet points, and the margin and padding keep them adequately spaced. I discovered what these things do by seeing what happened to the website when I tweaked the settings.\nSimilarly, for nav ul li a, we use block for display to place some space between the &lt;nav&gt; and the body below, and we also use some padding.\nBelow we can see where each CSS element corresponds to on the webpages:\n\n\n\nimage 2"

Just think of the follwing command as a blank canvas:\n\nconn = sqlite3.connect(\"files/climate.db\")\n\nWhy is it called connect? Well, connect actually looks for an existing file called climate.db in this case, but if it doesn’t exist, it will create one, so we also use the command to make new databases.\nBut, regardless of whether or not the file already exists, connect also, as the name suggests, connects to the file name in its argument (climate.db) in our case. This is what allows us to establish a link between our Python notebook and our database, which is essential. There are many other programs that can allow you to write and execute SQL queries, but sqlite is special in that we can just use our existing Python IDE as an interface to use SQL, but we need to connect to some sort of datbase in order to do that.\nAlso, you might be wondering why we stored the output of this function as conn. Think of it as like a variable name for our database so that we can more easily use it in later function calls."

    "text": "Part 1b: Preparing the Tables\nOkay, so now we actually need to populate our database with tables. To do this, we’re going to employ a method that comes with pandas called .to_sql() that allows us to turn a data frame into a SQL table within a database of our choice. First, though, we actually need to get our hands on our data. There are 3 .csv files that we’re interested in: one called temps that contains temperature data, one called station-metadata.csv which contains information about the weather stations where the aforementioned data was collected, and finally, one which we will call countries, which will allow us to identify the country (or region) in which each station is located. The first two files come from NOAA but were provided to my PIC16B class by my professor, Seyoon Ko. I would link these files, but they are behind our BruinLearn page. The last file was also provided by Professor Ko but was taken from the URL that appears in the code block below. I’m not sure who to attribute it to.\n(Note that, by the way, although we’re doing this because we want to avoid using too many memory-intensive operations, we’re going to have to load these files at least once into our notebook so that we can turn them into SQL tables in the first place).\n\ntemperatures = pd.read_csv('files/temps.csv')\nstations = pd.read_csv('files/station-metadata.csv')\ncountries = pd.read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mysociety/gaze/master/data/fips-10-4-to-iso-country-codes.csv\")\n#This may take a bit to run.\n\nWhile it’s tempting to immediately try to convert these 3 data frames into SQL tables, we first want to clean the data up a little bit. Let’s start with temps: (The following steps are taken exactly from Prof. Ko’s notebook)\n\ntemperatures.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID\nYear\nVALUE1\nVALUE2\nVALUE3\nVALUE4\nVALUE5\nVALUE6\nVALUE7\nVALUE8\nVALUE9\nVALUE10\nVALUE11\nVALUE12\n\n\n\n\n0\nACW00011604\n1961\n-89.0\n236.0\n472.0\n773.0\n1128.0\n1599.0\n1570.0\n1481.0\n1413.0\n1174.0\n510.0\n-39.0\n\n\n1\nACW00011604\n1962\n113.0\n85.0\n-154.0\n635.0\n908.0\n1381.0\n1510.0\n1393.0\n1163.0\n994.0\n323.0\n-126.0\n\n\n2\nACW00011604\n1963\n-713.0\n-553.0\n-99.0\n541.0\n1224.0\n1627.0\n1620.0\n1596.0\n1332.0\n940.0\n566.0\n-108.0\n\n\n3\nACW00011604\n1964\n62.0\n-85.0\n55.0\n738.0\n1219.0\n1442.0\n1506.0\n1557.0\n1221.0\n788.0\n546.0\n112.0\n\n\n4\nACW00011604\n1965\n44.0\n-105.0\n38.0\n590.0\n987.0\n1500.0\n1487.0\n1477.0\n1377.0\n974.0\n31.0\n-178.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a few major problems at the moment with this table, which you might’ve not known without prior information. Firstly, it’s unclear what the columns VALUE1 through VALUE12 refer to on their own, though you may be able to guess that they have to do with months. Indeed, they represent the average temperature taken at a given station in a given year during some month (VALUE1 being January and VALUE12 being December).\nThe units of the temperature, however, are actually in hundreths of a degree Celsius. This is not a unit that we’re used to working with.\nAnd finally, on a more qualitative side of things, it’s not the best idea to keep VALUE1 through VALUE12 as different columns. Why? Because, although they are presented as separate variables, they actually measure the same thing (namely, temperature in hundreths of a degree). In general, we should have it so that each column represents a distinct variable.\nSo, it seems that there are three problems that we need to solve:\n\nColumn names are ambiguous.\nUnits for data are not the best.\nData frame needs to be restructured.\n\nWe’ll start with the third item, since we shouldn’t worry about renaming things our changing units if we don’t even have the structure down in the first place. But how do we do this? In my previous blog post (HW 0), I briefly introduced the idea of stacking in pandas, and we’re going to be using that again this time.\nIf you don’t recall, here’s the basic idea of stacking: * Specify some column(s) that will be “preserved” * The .stack() method will combine all other columns into one big column Let’s give this a go:\n\ntemperatures = temperatures.set_index(keys = [\"ID\",\"Year\"])\ntemperatures = temperatures.stack()\ntemperatures.head()\n\nID           Year        \nACW00011604  1961  VALUE1     -89.0\n                   VALUE2     236.0\n                   VALUE3     472.0\n                   VALUE4     773.0\n                   VALUE5    1128.0\ndtype: float64\n\n\nOkay, so what did we do? First, we used the .set_index() method which allows us to turn a set of columns into the index of the data frame. This is important because these columns will not be stacked. In our case, we want to preserve the station ID and the year in which the measurement was taken.\nThen, the remaining columns are stacked (combine) into one “column” once we call .stack(). This actually turns the object into a pandas series. Recall from PIC16A that a series is like a generalization of a list that we can imagine as one column of a data frame. A series also has an index, which in our case, contains three different items for each numerical value (this technically makes it a MultiIndex): the ID and Year (which we already “preserved” when we called .set_index(), and any one of the 12 possible strings VALUE1 through VALUE12. This final item allows us to remember which column that got eliminated the observation originated from.\nBut, if we look at the index explicitly, we’ll notice an interesting detail:\n\ntemperatures.index\n\nMultiIndex([('ACW00011604', 1961,  'VALUE1'),\n            ('ACW00011604', 1961,  'VALUE2'),\n            ('ACW00011604', 1961,  'VALUE3'),\n            ('ACW00011604', 1961,  'VALUE4'),\n            ('ACW00011604', 1961,  'VALUE5'),\n            ('ACW00011604', 1961,  'VALUE6'),\n            ('ACW00011604', 1961,  'VALUE7'),\n            ('ACW00011604', 1961,  'VALUE8'),\n            ('ACW00011604', 1961,  'VALUE9'),\n            ('ACW00011604', 1961, 'VALUE10'),\n            ...\n            ('ZIXLT622116', 1970,  'VALUE3'),\n            ('ZIXLT622116', 1970,  'VALUE4'),\n            ('ZIXLT622116', 1970,  'VALUE5'),\n            ('ZIXLT622116', 1970,  'VALUE6'),\n            ('ZIXLT622116', 1970,  'VALUE7'),\n            ('ZIXLT622116', 1970,  'VALUE8'),\n            ('ZIXLT622116', 1970,  'VALUE9'),\n            ('ZIXLT622116', 1970, 'VALUE10'),\n            ('ZIXLT622116', 1970, 'VALUE11'),\n            ('ZIXLT622116', 1970, 'VALUE12')],\n           names=['ID', 'Year', None], length=13992662)\n\n\nWe see that each observation is explicitly linked to the three aforementioned pieces of information (ID, year, VALUE column). It’s as if that our series was really a data frame in disguise, where the first 3 columns are the items in the index (ID, year, and VALUE column name) while the last column is the actual “data” of the series (the temperature recordings).\nWell, we can actually force this data frame to resurge by calling the .reset_index() method on temperatures, which eliminates the index that we manually specified above and replaces it with the default one (just numbers), but this would turn the current MultiIndex into “data columns” which is not possible in a Series, so temperatures will revert to being a data frame. The nicest and most important part, however, is because the VALUE column name is now in our index, it will be added as a new column within our data frame.\n\ntemperatures = temperatures.reset_index()\ntemperatures.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID\nYear\nlevel_2\n0\n\n\n\n\n0\nACW00011604\n1961\nVALUE1\n-89.0\n\n\n1\nACW00011604\n1961\nVALUE2\n236.0\n\n\n2\nACW00011604\n1961\nVALUE3\n472.0\n\n\n3\nACW00011604\n1961\nVALUE4\n773.0\n\n\n4\nACW00011604\n1961\nVALUE5\n1128.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe names of the columns ID and Year are preserved since they were in the index of our series. Our new VALUE name column is given a default name level_2, and the temperature column is called 0 since our series data didn’t have any name associated with it. From here, though, we can fix the other two problems we had earlier: the naming of our columns and the units of our recordings!\nFirst, let’s rename (using the .rename() method) our columns to something that we can interpret more easily. Note that the string that we have for VALUE precisely corresponds to the month in which the observation was made, so we name this column Month.\nNote that the columns argument of .rename() is a dictionary where the keys are the existing column names and the values are the names that we wish to give to the columns.\n\ntemperatures = temperatures.rename(columns = {\"level_2\"  : \"Month\" , 0 : \"Temp\"}) #Input as a dictionary.\ntemperatures.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID\nYear\nMonth\nTemp\n\n\n\n\n0\nACW00011604\n1961\nVALUE1\n-89.0\n\n\n1\nACW00011604\n1961\nVALUE2\n236.0\n\n\n2\nACW00011604\n1961\nVALUE3\n472.0\n\n\n3\nACW00011604\n1961\nVALUE4\n773.0\n\n\n4\nACW00011604\n1961\nVALUE5\n1128.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we don’t want the values of the Month column to be have the VALUE string beforehand. It would make a lot more sense to just store the number at the very end. We also need to convert it to an integer (since right now it’s merely a string).\nWe’ll also divide the Temp column by 100.\n\ntemperatures[\"Month\"] = temperatures[\"Month\"].str[5:].astype(int) \ntemperatures[\"Temp\"]  = temperatures[\"Temp\"] / 100 \n\n\ntemperatures.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID\nYear\nMonth\nTemp\n\n\n\n\n0\nACW00011604\n1961\n1\n-0.89\n\n\n1\nACW00011604\n1961\n2\n2.36\n\n\n2\nACW00011604\n1961\n3\n4.72\n\n\n3\nACW00011604\n1961\n4\n7.73\n\n\n4\nACW00011604\n1961\n5\n11.28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooks pretty good to me!

    "section": "1c: Conversion to SQL Tables",
    "text": "1c: Conversion to SQL Tables\nWe’re almost ready to place our data into our empty climate.db file that we created earlier. But, before we do that, there’s one more thing we need to keep in mind: memory usage. Recall that we will be using the .to_sql() method to turn our data frames into tables. This essentially requires a large transfer of data which might be dangerous or annoying if we have very big files. We can measure the memory used by our current frames with the memory_usage() method (note that the results are an approximation).\nSee the documentation in the link below for more details. The argument deep = True more correctly considers the memory taken up by string. By default, the function outputs results by column, so .sum() will tell us the total memory usage in bytes.\nDocumentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.memory_usage.html).\n\nprint(\"Memory used by `countries`: \", round(countries.memory_usage(deep = True).sum()/1024,2), \"kilobytes\")\nprint(\"Memory used by `stations`: \", round(stations.memory_usage(deep = True).sum()/1024,2), \"kilobytes\")\nprint(\"Memory used by `temperatures`: \", round(temperatures.memory_usage(deep = True).sum()/1024,2), \"kilobytes\")\n\nMemory used by `countries`:  50.62 kilobytes\nMemory used by `stations`:  4340.02 kilobytes\nMemory used by `temps`:  1257153.36 kilobytes\n\n\ncountries is relatively small, only taking up about 50.6 kilobytes. stations, however, seems to take up more than 4 megabytes. temperatures, though is massive!\n\nprint(\"Memory used by `temperatures`: \", round(temperatures.memory_usage(deep = True).sum()/(1024**2),2), \"megabytes\")\n\nMemory used by `temps`:  1227.69 megabytes\n\n\nThis is more than a gigabyte of data! This is really big, and it would probably be unwise to directly turn it into a SQL table. Let’s, then, start with countries and stations first, and we’ll save the biggest for last.\n\ncursor = conn.cursor()\nstations.to_sql(\"stations\", conn, if_exists = \"replace\", index = False)\n\n27585\n\n\nAssuming everything’s gone well, climate.db now contains our table!\nLet’s break down the above command. The first argument specifies the name we want to give to our table, which will still be stations. The second argument is the database that we want to place it in (remember what I said earlier about conn representing climate.db?). The argument if_exists tells us what to do if we happen to find a table in our database that’s already called stations. Since our database is empty, we won’t find any such tables, but by setting the argument to replace, we will overwrite any files with the same name. index = False indicates that we do not want to transfer over the index of our data frame into the table.\nThe numerical output of our method call, by the way, is the number of rows in our table\nLet’s do the same thing with countries.\n\ncountries.to_sql(\"countries\", conn, if_exists = \"replace\", index = False)\n\n279\n\n\nNow, let’s move onto temperatures. How are we going to transfer more than a gigabyte of data? The answer is by doing so bit by bit. Specifically, we can iteratively transfer pieces of our data frame called chunks into our database. In the original Python notebook from class, our professor created a for loop that took advantage of an argument inside of read_csv() called chunksize that created an iterator out of our original data divided into a set number of pieces.\nIn that for loop, our professor used a function he created that would clean the data frame as we did above before creating the iterator. So, even though we’ve already cleaned our data above, let’s walk through the steps one more time so that we can implement this for our iterator:\n\nUse .set_index() and .stack() to place all temperature measurements in one column (series).\nConvert this series back into a data frame with .reset_index()\nEdit and rename the Month and Temp columns.\n\nLet’s make a function that does this for a data frame. The idea will then be to apply this function onto different chunks of the original data before finally combining them into a table in our database.\n\n#This function is taken directly from Professor Ko's notebook.\n#I rename it to `prepare_temps` to make its usage explicit:\n\ndef prepare_temps(df):\n    \"\"\"\n    Cleans a chunk ``df`` of the `temps.csv` file based on the criteria elaborated\n    earlier. Note that this function implicitly assumes that its argument comes\n    from `temps.csv`. It will otherwise likely throw an error since it relies\n    on the existence of certain column names.\n    \"\"\"\n    df = df.set_index(keys=[\"ID\", \"Year\"]) #\"Row names\"\n    df = df.stack() #Everything else (temperature names) gets stacked\n    df = df.reset_index() #Converts MultiIndex into columns\n    df = df.rename(columns = {\"level_2\"  : \"Month\" , 0 : \"Temp\"}) #Renames new columns\n    df[\"Month\"] = df[\"Month\"].str[5:].astype(int) #Converts `Month` to integer\n    df[\"Temp\"]  = df[\"Temp\"] / 100 #Convert to degrees Celsius\n    return(df)\n\nNow, let’s make our iterator. We’ll be using a chunksize of 100000 just like Professor Ko, which splits our data frame into pieces of about 19 MB.\n\ntemps_iter = pd.read_csv(\"temps.csv\", chunksize = 100000)\n\nOur general idea is to go through each chunk of the data and then clean it. Then, once the chunk is cleaned, we’ll add it to the database in a table called temps. Note that because of this iterative method, the if_exists arugment of .to_sql() becomes relevant, since after we input the first chunk, a table called temps already exists. We’ll make sure to use the other possible value of if_exists, 'append', to add onto our table. The code chunk below is also taken from Professor Ko.\n\nfor i, temps_chunk in enumerate(temps_iter):\n    df = prepare_temps(temps_chunk)\n    df.to_sql(\"temperatures\", conn,\n              if_exists = \"replace\" if i == 0 else \"append\", index = False)\n\nFirstly, to properly iterate through temps_iter, we should be using the enumerate() function. If you recall from PIC16A, this essentially creates the idea of an index and a value (almost like a dictionary) for our iterator. The “value”, in this case, is a pandas DataFrame object that has (initially) 100000 rows. This is why we’re able to then input temps_chunk into the prepare_temps() function we wrote earlier.\nAs for if_exists, we will only replace an existing table called temperatures (which should not exist) during the first iteration. For all other chunks, we’ll append to the table that is created during the first iteration.\nAs good practice, we should close the connection that we made between this notebook and climate.db, since now that our file has all the information we need, we only need to access it while we’re running queries or making edits!\n\nconn.close()"

The first thing that we do in our function’s body is call the query_climate_database function according to the inputs given by the user. Then, using this data frame, we make a new column to our resulting data frame queried_data called Name_Count which records the number of times each station appears in the query. We do this by combining the .groupby() and .transform() methods. I explained .groupby() in my previous post, but .transform() is new. It allows us to apply a function as specified in its input (in this case, count) to each group. Thus, .transform('count') counts the number of observation in each NAME group. What’s special about the function .transform, however, is that its results will be placed as a new column within our data frame. For instance, if the station PBO_ANANTAPUR appears 15 different times in query_climate_database, each row pertaining to that station will have a value of 15 in Name_Count–even though the number of groups is much smaller than the total number of rows, .transform() allows us to preserve our data frame’s structure while still adding group-level information!\nThe next line creates a new data frame called filtered_data that is essentially identical to queried_data, except we drop all rows where Name_Count is less than min_obs. Notice that because we were able to get count displayed for every row, the rows whose NAME appears precisely fewer than min_obs times will be deleted. We also drop the ‘Name_Count’ column since it will no longer be useful for us."

    "text": "Part 3b: Explanation of Regression Coefficient Collection\nThe next step is by far the most complicated. Essentially, we are aiming to group each station by name and run a linear regression of Temp on Year and extract the slope of the line. To do this, we are going to use another method that allows us to use a function on part of a data frame. This time, though, we’re going to instead use a method called .apply() because .transform() only works with one column at a time, whereas .apply() let us work with multiple columns (something we need for a regression!). See this StackOverflow post for more details: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27517425/whether-to-use-apply-vs-transform-on-a-group-object-to-subtract-two-columns-and.\nThere is no function (at least that I know of) that returns the slope coefficient of a linear regression automatically, so we have to write one ourselves. This is why there is a function called coef above my function definition, which I took from Professor Ko with a few slight modifications. For a given data_group (the chunks we get out of .groupby()), we store the Year column in a data frame x and the Temps column in a series y. The reason x is a data frame is because, if you recall from PIC16A, data matrices are automatically assumed to be data frames since they can have multiple dimensions. We then create a new regression called LR, fit it on x and y, and return the slope of the line rounded to 4 digits (this should also be review from PIC16A).\nWhen we use apply on our data frame, the output of the function will, in this case, be a pandas Series where the index is the NAME of the station and the values are the coefficient correlation. Note that unlike with .transform, there will only be one entry per group, so we cannot simply append the column. Instead, we first convert the series into a data frame by converting the index into its own column with reset_index(), and then we give the column containing our coefficients an appropriate name (Estimated Yearly Increase (°C)).\nThen, we use pd.merge to combine our filtered query data with the coefficient data. The column that we’re looking for in common is NAME, and then we execute a left join, which allows us to keep rows in our filtered query data even if, somehow, it wasn’t possible to run coef. pd.merge checks each row of filtered_data, looks at its entry in NAME, finds the corresponding entry in coef_frame, and appends the values of coef_frame onto the row of filtered_data. This allows us to add this information onto filtered_data even though coef_frame has much fewer rows. We call the result merged_frame."

    "section": "Part 3c: Explanation of Graphing",
    "text": "Part 3c: Explanation of Graphing\nNow that we have our data prepared, we can actually create our plot, which will rely on express from plotly (which we imported as px). express allows us to create many different types of plots very easily, akin to ggplot2 from R if you have any experience with that. Before actually making the plot, though, I’ve prepared its title beforehand. It is once again an f-string which allows us to specifically state the country, beginning year, and ending year for which the data was collected. Since the column Month is a number, however, we create a dictionary called month_dict that maps each numerical value of Month with its word equivalent, which we then place into the title.\nThe actual command to create the plot is px.scatter_mapbox. scatter means that we’re making a scatterplot, and mapbox means that, instead of placing our points on, say, an x-y grid, we’re instead placing them on a map of the Earth (which is still an x-y grid but with latitude and longitude). The first argument is the name of the data frame that we’re interested in using (merged_frame), and the following arguments rely on the columns of merged_frame: lat and lon are the latitude and longitude of our points, respectively, which we were able to take from stations. Because plotly graphs are interactive, we’re allowed to see information when we hover our cursor over individual points, which is why we set hover_name = 'NAME', which will let us know the station name, and the most important part, the color, is controlled by 'Estimated Yearly Increase (°C)'.\nThose are actually all the necessary arguments of px.scatter_mapbox to get our plot working, but we can include more. color_continuous_scale lets us pick what sort of color scheme we want for our points. zoom controls how far zoomed in we are on the map when we call our function, color_continuous_midpoint allows us to set a ‘neutral’ value for our color scale at a certain value (0 in this case, since temperatures can either be going up or down over time), opacity controls how transparent the points are, and finally, title controls, of course, the title. Most of these arguments are of the form kwargs.get(value, default). This is related to the **kwargs in the function header: when the function is called, any arguments in addition to those required will be placed into a dictionary called kwargs whose keys are the argument name and values are the value inputted for that variable. kwargs.get allows us to access that dictionary and input the value for that variable within our function. The second value, however, is simply the default that will be used if no additional input was specified by the user. For example, we have opacity = kwargs.get('opacity',0.2), which will set the opacity value to whatever the user specified, and otherwise, will set it to 0.2.\nFinally, we run two more commands once we actually create our graph that alter it (via update_layout): one changes something called mapbox_style, and the other simply changes the dimensions of the plot. As for the first command, when we create our plot, you can almost think of the map as just a picture that we lay points on top of depending on some coordinates. As such, we can change the type of map in the background to whatever we want, provided that the coordinates are aligned correctly. By default, we will use one called open-street-map.\nHere’s a demonstration for India between 1980 and 2020 for the month of January:\n\ncolor_map = px.colors.diverging.RdGy_r # choose a colormap\n\nfig = temperature_coefficient_plot('climate.db',\"India\", 1980, 2020, 1, \n                                   min_obs = 10,\n                                   zoom = 2,\n                                   mapbox_style=\"carto-positron\",\n                                   color_continuous_scale=color_map)\n\nfig.show()\n\n\n\n\nYou can zoom into the map and see for yourself how temperatures have changed over the years. By hovering over the individual points, you can also see the name of each station, the latitude, longitude, and the estimated yearly temperature increase. Note that while we only specified hover_name = \"NAME\", by default, information about the x and y coordinates (i.e., the latitude and longitude) as well as the variable used in color will also be displayed.\nIf you come across this notebook, feel free to play around with the inputs of the function. You will find that, all across the world, temperatures have been increasing at an alarming rate. Here’s another example of Mexico in September:\n\ntemperature_coefficient_plot('climate.db', 'Mexico', 1980, 2020, 9, min_obs = 10)"

    "section": "Part 4a: Changes in Temperature Ranges",
    "text": "Part 4a: Changes in Temperature Ranges\nOne of the consequences of global warming that people sometimes forget is that it doesn’t necessarily make the temperature of every single part of the earth hotter at the same time, even if average temperatures are increasing. Rather, climate change can also increase the impact of extreme weather events.\nAs such, it would be interesting to see how the yearly range in temperature has changed over time; perhaps temperatures used to be pretty constantly mild throughout the entire year, but now, they jump to highs in the summer and lows in the winter.\nTo find out how these have changed over the time, we’re going to create a new SQL querying function called min_max_query and incorporate it into a function called min_max_plot. min_max_plot will be a series of histograms that will display the range of temperature for all stations within a given country. First, I’ll show a screenshot of a sample plot, and then we’ll dive deeper into the code:\n\n\n\nMin Max Image\n\n\nI’ve zoomed the picture out so that we can see the whole thing, but there are a few things that we’d like to keep in mind:\n\nThe user should be able to specify the range of time during which we track the changes.\nThe user should also be able to specify how many graphs they would like to see.\nAdditional information (such as the number of observations and the median range) should also be displayed for ease of viewing.\n\nTherefore, our SQL query should include sufficient information about our country of interest, the date range, and the temperatures. While this wasn’t covered in class, SQL also has MAX() and MIN() functions (which I learned about for my internship, so we can get this part of the work cut out for us in the SQL query. Below I show the code for min_max_query:\n\nfrom climate_database import min_max_query\nimport inspect\nprint(inspect.getsource(min_max_query))\n\ndef min_max_query(db_file, country, year_begin, year_end):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function uses `sqlite3` to query a .db database ``db_file`` for temperature data in ``country`` between\n    the years of ``year_begin`` and ``year_end`` (inclusive).\n    The output is a `pandas` data frame ``df`` which contains the following columns:\n    ``NAME``: The name of the weather station where the temperature was measured.\n     ``Year``: The year during which the measurement was taken, will be between ``year_begin`` and ``year_end``, inclusive.\n     ``temp_max``: The maximum temperature during a specific year at a given station.\n     ``temp_min``: The minimum temperature during a specific year at a given station.\n    \"\"\"\n    with sqlite3.connect(f\"{db_file}\") as conn:\n\n        cmd = \\\n        f\"\"\"\n        SELECT t2.NAME, t2.Year, MAX(Temp) AS temp_max, MIN(Temp) AS temp_min FROM\n        (SELECT S.NAME, t1.Name AS Country, t1.Year, t1.Temp\n        FROM stations S\n        INNER JOIN\n        (SELECT T.ID, T.Year, T.Temp, C.Name\n        FROM temperatures T\n        LEFT JOIN countries C ON SUBSTRING(T.ID,1,2) = C.\"FIPS 10-4\"\n        WHERE C.Name = \"{country}\" AND T.Year BETWEEN {year_begin} AND {year_end})\n        AS t1 ON S.ID = t1.ID) as t2\n        GROUP BY NAME, Year\n        \"\"\"\n\n        df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn)\n\n        return df\n\n\n\nThe basic structure is identical to that of query_climate_database, so let’s just focus on what exactly is going on in the query itself. We see once again that we use subquerying, but here, we have two subqueries. The innermost one joins the temperatures and countries tables, almost identically to the subqery of query_climate_database, with less restrictive WHERE conditions since we don’t need to restrict to a certain month (that would defeat the purpose of getting a yearly range). The output of this first query is called t1. The second subquery then joins t1 with stations, giving us the station name, and joining where the IDs are equivalent (just as in query_climate_database). This second result is saved as t2.\nFinally, from t2 we grab NAME, Year, as well as MAX(TEMP) and MIN(TEMP) (which have slightly prettier names). This does not grab the maximum and minimum temperatures for all of t2, however. Just like with pandas data frames, we can use GROUP BY statements in SQL, but they go at the very end of a query. Here, we group by NAME, Year, which means that we group by every possible name-year combination (i.e., grouping two-dimensionally). This allows us to get the maximum and minimum temperatures for a specific station in a specific year, separate from all other max/min temperatures for that same station in a different year.\nNow we need to make the actual plotting function. Skip to the code block below the function body to see the explanation. Once again, I define some helper functions that we will with transform as well.\n\ndef min_max_plot(db_file, country, year_begin, year_end, graph_num):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function creates a series of ``graph_num`` stacked histograms displaying\n    the range of temperatures measured at stations in ``country`` between\n    ``year_begin`` and ``year_end``, inclusive. It obtains the data using\n    `sqlite3` via the `min_max_query` function to query a `.db` database file \n    ``db_file`` to obtain the maximum and minimum temperatures at weather stations.\n    The function manipulates the resulting data frame to calculate the temperature\n    range at all stations for all valid years. It then calculates the years for\n    which graphs will be shown via linear interpolation between ``year_begin`` and\n    ``year_end``, with non-integer years being rounded to the nearest integer.\n    The plot, made using `plotly express` displays the histograms along with a\n    dotted line showing the median temperature range and with annotations\n    indicating the median value as well as the number of observations in the given year.\n    \"\"\"\n    queried_data = min_max_query(db_file, country, year_begin, year_end) #Run the query\n    \n    queried_data[\"Hi-Low Difference\"] = queried_data[\"temp_max\"] - queried_data[\"temp_min\"] #Calculate the differnece\n    \n    slope = (year_end-year_begin)/(graph_num -1)\n    intercept = year_begin - slope\n    year_list = []\n    for i in range(graph_num):\n        year_list.append(round(intercept+slope*(i+1),0))\n        #Obtain the years required for the graphs\n\n    \n    filtered_query = queried_data[queried_data['Year'].isin(year_list)].sort_values('Year')\n    #Filter to specified years\n    \n    title_string = f\"Distribution of Yearly Temperature Ranges (°C) for Stations in {country} between {year_begin} and {year_end} (Median in Red)\"\n    \n    fig = px.histogram(filtered_query, x='Hi-Low Difference', opacity = 0.5, nbins = 25,\n                       facet_row = \"Year\", title = title_string) #Create graph\n    fig.update_yaxes(title_text='Occurrences') #Change facet titles\n    \n    median_values = filtered_query.groupby('Year')['Hi-Low Difference'].median()[::-1]\n    counts = list(filtered_query.groupby('Year').count()['NAME'])[::-1]\n    y_cord = np.median(counts) #Collect medians and observation numbers\n\n    \n    for row_num, median_value in enumerate(median_values): #(Over all facets)\n        fig.add_vline(x=median_value, line_dash='dash', line_color='red',\n                      col=1, row=row_num+1) #Add line signaling median\n        fig.add_annotation(xref='paper', yref='paper', x=0.5, y=y_cord/8, \n                       text=f\"(n = {counts[row_num]})\", showarrow=False,\n                       col=1, row=row_num+1) #Add number of observations\n        fig.add_annotation(xref='paper', yref='paper', x=0.5, y=y_cord/4, \n                       text=f\"Median: {round(median_value,2)}\", showarrow=False,\n                       col=1, row=row_num+1, font = {'color':'red'}) #Add median value\n    fig.update_layout(height = 1000)\n    fig.update_traces(marker_line_width=1, marker_line_color='black') #Add border to graph\n    fig.show()\n    return filtered_query #Also return data frame\n\nThere’s a lot of code, so let’s digest it bit by bit.\n\nPart 4a(i): Data Frame Manipulation\nOur first order of business is to create a new column, which we name Hi-Low Difference that contains the difference between the highest and lowest temperatures recorded in a given year. We then create variables called slope and intercept which will help us figure out what years we want to include in our final plot; remember, we want to include graph_num graphs between year_begin and year_end, so we only need to keep data corresponding to so many years.\nI decided to make this in the form of a linear function to make it more easily visualized. Suppose, for instance, that year_begin = 1980, year_end = 2014, and graph_num = 6. If we can imagine graph 1 (input) corresponding to 1980 (output) and graph 6 to 2014, the slope of the line connecting \\((1,1980)\\) to \\((6,2014)\\) is precisely \\(\\frac{2014-1980}{6-1} = \\frac{{end}-{begin}}{num-1}\\). So, if graph 1 corresponds to 1980, we need that the output for 1 is 1980, so we have \\(1980 = slope\\cdot(1)+intercept \\Rightarrow intercept = 1980-slope \\Rightarrow intercept = begin - slope\\)\nThen, we have a list called year_list which will contain the list of years that we need. We create a for loop that iterates over the number of necessary graphs and obtains the output of the linear equation above for different numbered graphs. We then round the output to the nearest whole number. This is because there is no guarantee that we will be able to fit a whole number of graphs between year_begin and year_end. The result of this, of course, is that the graphs will not be completely evenly spaced, but in that case, we would simply have no choice.\nWe then make a new data frame called filtered_query that selects only the rows such that the year is included within year_list. For this, we use the .isin() method, and furthermore, I sort my data frame using sort_values by year because, otherwise, the faceted graphs do not end up in chronological order.\n\n\nPart 4a(ii): Plot Creation\nWe once again create a title string and then call a px function, this time histogram, which creates a bar graph that shows the frequencies of a certain variable. The variable in question, Hi-Low Differnece is placed along the horizontal axis, which is why we place it into the argument x (if you use y, you can have a histogram that sticks out horizontally!). I specify that the number of bins should be 25 (that looked good while testing). Then, I introduce facet_row = year. Recall that a facet in this context can be thought of like a subplot from matplotlib. Essentially, we are duplicating a graph with the same characteristics, except for the fact that it should be limited to a certain year. Note that by specifying the argument as facet_row and not facet_column, the histograms are stacked vertically.\n\n\nPart 4a(iii): Plot Customization\nI had to look up the documentation for a lot of the functions and methods we use in this part since we didn’t look too deeply into facets and histograms in lecture. The first thing we do is call a method called update_yaxes to change the name of the y-axis label for the histogram. The default label is “count”. We then create a list of the medians and the occurrences for each histogram by taking filtered_query, grouping by year, and then using the .median() and .count() (should be review from PIC16A). We also create a variable called y_cord and set it to the median of counts, (see below).\nThen we use a for loop with enumerate on median_values to iterate over all facets with an index i. From here, we use two different methods on fig: add_vline and add_annotation, similar to functions from ggplot2()in R. .add_vline places a vertical line in a graph of a specified shape (dashed in our case) and color (red) at a specific x coordiante, which I place exactly at the median, since the point of the dotted line is to see where the median is. Notice that arguments row and col are also included, which correspond to the “coordinates” of the facet. This indexing starts from 1, not 0. Also, even though there is only one column of graphs, the code will not compile unless a row is specified.\nadd_annotation is used for placing text on top of the plot. The first two arguments, xref and yref control the text’s position. By setting it to paper, the subsequent inputs for x and y will be based on their positioning within the space of the graph . See the documentation here for more information: https://plotly.com/python-api-reference/generated/plotly.graph_objects.Figure.html\nThe x values of both pieces of text are set to 0.5 to keep it towards the left-hand side. The y values, however, depend on y_cord (the median of counts). This is because the relative position of the text to the height of the histogram bars depends on the number of per-country observations, so this always keeps the text around the same place. text contains the raw text itself–the number of observations and the median, respectively. In both cases, showArrow is set to False. Were this to be instead True, there would be a small black line on the plot pointing to the text. We once again specify row and column to align with our facets, and finally, we set the color of our median text to be red. This has to be done through an argument called font, which is a dictionary. I didn’t look up what all the other possible keys are, but I imagine that the color is just one of them.\nThen, I change the height using update_layout (so they are not squished), and finally, .update_traces allows us to put borders on the edges of our histogram bars. The program finishes by showing the plot and also by returning filtered_query as a data frame, in case the user wants to inspect the source of the data further.\nSo, how how has the yearly temperature range changed with time? Here are a few examples from a few different countries:\n\nmin_max_1 = min_max_plot(\"climate.db\", \"India\", 1960, 2020, 6)\n\n\n\n\n\nmin_max_2 = min_max_plot(\"climate.db\", \"United States\", 1960, 2020, 6)\n\n\n\n\n\nmin_max_3 = min_max_plot(\"climate.db\", \"Russia\", 1960, 2020, 6)\n\n\n\n\n\nmin_max_4 = min_max_plot(\"climate.db\", \"Canada\", 1960, 2020, 6)\n\n\n\n\nFrom these graphs alone, it’s hard to say whether or not there has been a significant shift in the median difference between high temperatures and low temperatures in a year in the above countries, but what all of them have in common is that the measurements in the past couple of decades seem to have lower medians than the earlier ones, which might actually suggest that temperatures are converging rather than diverging!"

It is important to understand what makes certain communities more susceptible or resistant to global warming, and one factor that may be at play is elevation. From what we can guess, it would make sense that higher areas have lower temperatures, so let’s ask a more interesting question: does the year-to-year volatility in temperatures depend on elevation? How would temperatures change from one year to the next at sea level? At 1000 feet? At 2000?\nThat’s what I want to find out, and to do this, we’re going to make one more function that allows us to visualize a plot, in particular, a scatter plot, and in order to be able to gain a conclusion from a scatter plot, we also want to see a regression output. Here’s what a final version should look like:\n\n\n\nElevation Graph\n\n\nOnce again, we’re going to have to write a new query function, which we’ll call elevation_query, especially because we’re using a variable that we haven’t used before. Then, we’ll write a function called elevation_temp_plotter which calls the query function. Here are the broad steps that we’re going to need:\n\nWrite and call the query function based on user input specifying a certain low and high height at which to compare temperature data.\nManipulate the data frame so that we see the absolute difference between subsequent years’ temperatures.\nStore the data for the regression between the temperature differences and elevation deviation so that we can add it onto our plot.\nPlot a faceted scatterplot using plotly express\nAdd the regression line.\nAdd any other necessary features.\n\nLet’s start with the query function:\n\nfrom climate_database import elevation_query\nimport inspect\nprint(inspect.getsource(elevation_query))\n\ndef elevation_query(db_file, month, year_begin, year_end, elev_below_center, elev_above_center, radius):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function uses `sqlite3` to query a `.db` database file ``db_file`` and returns a data frame ``df``\n    containing the following columns:\n    ``NAME``: The name of valid weather stations. \n    ``STNELEV``: Each station's elevation in feet. Must be within ``radius`` feet of ``elev_below_center`` or ``elev_above_center``\n    ``LATITUDE``: Each station's latitude.\n    ``LONGITUDE``: Each station's longitude.\n    ``Country``: The name of the country where the recoridng was taken.\n    ``Year``: The year when the recording was taken, between ``year_begin`` and ``year_end``, inclusive.\n    ``Month``: The month when the recording was taken, equal to ``month``.\n    ``Temp``: The temperature recording at that station at that point in time.\n    \"\"\"\n    with sqlite3.connect(f\"{db_file}\") as conn:\n        cmd = \\\n        f\"\"\"\n        SELECT S.NAME, S.STNELEV, S.LATITUDE, S.LONGITUDE, t1.Name AS Country, t1.Year, t1.Month, t1.Temp\n        FROM stations S\n        INNER JOIN\n        (SELECT T.ID, T.Year, T.Month, T.Temp, C.Name\n        FROM temperatures T\n        LEFT JOIN countries C ON SUBSTRING(T.ID,1,2) = C.\"FIPS 10-4\"\n        WHERE T.Year BETWEEN {year_begin} AND {year_end} AND T.Month = {month})\n        AS t1 ON S.ID = t1.ID\n        WHERE ((S.STNELEV BETWEEN {elev_above_center-radius} AND {elev_above_center+radius}) OR (S.STNELEV BETWEEN {elev_below_center-radius} AND {elev_below_center+radius})) AND S.STNELEV != 9999\n        \"\"\"\n        df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn)\n        \n        return df\n\n\n\nBy now, you should be getting the hang of SQL queries. Our inner subquery joins temps onto countries in accordance to the range year_begin and year_end, the result of which we call t1. Then, we join stations onto t1 using the ID column as we had before, but this time, we have a very long WHERE condition that takes advantage of f-strings once again: the elevation must be within radius feet of either elev_above_center or elev_below_center. These two user-inputted parameters determine the elevation at which we center our scatterplot. Of course, we also want to be able to control how far from this center our observations can be–we don’t want any overlap! That’s why we use the radius variable.\nOkay, now let’s move onto elevation_temp_plotter itself. This time, we’re going to be relying on 3 different helper functions, so make sure to scroll down far enough!\n\ndef altitude_check(group, elev_below_center, radius):\n    \"\"\"\n    This is a helper function to be used with `elevation_temp_plotter` and simply\n    categorizes stations as being either 'Low' or 'High' depending on their\n    closeness to ``elev_below_center`` or ``elev_above_center``\n    \"\"\"\n    if (np.mean(group) &gt;= elev_below_center - radius) and (np.mean(group) &lt;= elev_below_center + radius):\n        return 'Low'\n    else:\n        return 'High'\n\n\ndef relative_height_difference(x, elev_below_center, elev_above_center):\n    \"\"\"\n    This is a helper function to be used with `elevation_temp_plotter` and\n    calculates the distance between each station's\n    elevation ``STNELEV`` and either `elev_below_center` or `elev_above_center`\n    \"\"\"\n    if x['Relative Height'] == 'Low':\n        return x['STNELEV'] - elev_below_center\n    else:\n        return x['STNELEV'] - elev_above_center\n\n\ndef coef_elev(data_group):\n    \"\"\"\n    This is a helper function to be used with `elevation_temp_plotter` and returns\n    a tuple containing `numpy` arrays that will be used for plotting regression\n    lines and also the regression intercept/coefficients for printing onto plots.\n    \"\"\"\n    x = data_group[[\"Distance from Center\"]] # 2 brackets because X should be a df no matter what\n    y = data_group[\"Diff from Last\"]   # 1 bracket because y should be a series\n    LR = LinearRegression()\n    LR.fit(x, y)\n    reg_info = np.array([LR.intercept_, LR.coef_[0]])\n    x_vals = np.linspace(data_group['Distance from Center'].min(),\n                         data_group['Distance from Center'].max(),100)\n    y_vals = LR.predict(x_vals.reshape(-1,1))\n    return (np.column_stack((x_vals, y_vals)),reg_info)\n\n\ndef elevation_temp_plotter(db_file,month,year_begin,year_end,elev_below_center,elev_above_center, radius):\n    \"\"\"\n     This function creates two scatterplots in ``plotly express`` displaying the\n     yearly change in temperatures during ``month`` at all weather stations whose\n     elevations are within ``radius`` feet of ``elev_below_center`` and \n     ``elev_above_center`` in ``country`` between ``year_begin`` and ``year_end``,\n     inclusive. It obtains the data using `sqlite3` via the ``elevation_query``\n     function to query a `.db` database file ``db_file`` to obtain the relevant\n     temperature recordings. The function manipulates the resulting data frame to\n     calculate the absolute value change in temperatures from one year to the next.\n    The function creates faceted scatterplots, each displaying data centered around\n    ``elev_below_center`` and ``elev_above_center`` The horizontal axis does not\n    display the altitude, but rather, distance from ``elev_below_center`` and\n    ``elev_above_center``, respectively. The OLS regression line for each\n    scatterplot is also displayed with the equation printed as an annotation for\n    each one. The function returns the data frame used for the plot for reference.\n\n    This function relies on functions ``altitude_check``, ``relative_height_difference``,\n    and ``coef_elev`` to manipulate the data frame and obtain regression\n    information.

Let’s take it step by step.\n\nPart 4b(i): Data Frame Manipulation\nThe first thing we do is to run our query using elevation_query using the variables entered through the function call, with the notable exception being the initial year is year_begin -1. This is because we will be differencing our data, and as such, the earliest year’s observation for each station will become an NaN value since it has nothing to be compared against, so we go one year back in order to obtain a valid value.\nThen, we make a column called Diff From Last which uses the .diff() method from pandas to calculate the difference in temperature between one year and the next at a given station. We take the absolute value using .abs() since we’re interested in overall volatility, and we make sure to drop any NaNs to eliminate the recordings for the year year_begin -1. Note that in this case, we group by both NAME and LATITUDE because we are not filtering our data by country. In fact, there are several stations that happen to have the same name but in different countries! Furthermore, we can’t group by country either since there are some stations that aren’t located in any country (such as in the ocean) and therefore, their country label is called None (there was some trial and error in figuring this out :)).\nNext, we create a column called Relative Height which employs .transform() to apply a function called altitude_check onto the STNELEV column, grouped by station. Note that because altitude_check has multiple arguments, we can actually pass these into .transform() itself as additional arguments. altitude_check inspects station group and checks whether or not the mean of the group’s height (this should be the same as each individual STNELEV value since the station isn’t moving) is within radius feet of elev_below_center. If it is, it sets the value of Relative Height to 'Low', and otherwise, the station must be within radius feet of elev_above_center, so we assign these rows 'High'.\nWe then use Relative Height via .apply() to create a column called Distance from Center. Once again, we use .apply() here and not .transform() because we need information from multiple columns. Here we once again do a simple logical check: if Relative Height is 'Low', then we simply take the station’s elevation and subtract elev_below_center, which will give us the signed difference in elevation between the station and the center. If all works well, Distance form Center should be within -radius and radius.\n\n\nPart 4b(ii): Regression Information\nWe then create an object (a tuple, actually) called coef_info that is not stored in queried_data, but rather, is kept separate. We use .apply again on a function called coef_elev so that we can have a customizable output, where our two groups are the 'Low' and 'High' values of Relative Height. We do it this way so that we can make a different regression for each group, which will translate nicely onto our faceted plot.\ncoef_elev is the most complex helper function that we’ve made for this post, but at its core, it’s quite similar to the coef function that we used for the first data visualization that we made. We’re going to want to be comparing the Distance from Center column to Diff from Last so that we can see how a one unit change in elevation (centered at either elev_below_center or elev_above_center) is related to the volatility in temperatures. We create a linear regression object LR and fit it to our data matrices, and in order to actually make something that we can graph, recall how we can use np.linspace() and .predict() to create x and y values that we can plot.\nThe function returns a single numpy array containing both the x and y values as well as the intercept/coefficient information of the regression, which we’ll use when created annotations on our graph to write our equation.\n\n\nPart 4b(iii): Plotting and Initial Changes\nNow comes the actual plotting. First we create a dictionary month_dict which, as it did in our original plot, will allow us to display month names in title_string, which is an adequately labeled f-string.\nThen we call px.scatter where we use queried_data as our source and our relevant x and y values. We also make it so that the user can hover over individual observations and see, in large text, the name of the station (hover_name = 'NAME') and also see secondary information about the country, latitude, and longitude of the station (hover_data = ['Country', 'LATITUDE', 'LONGITUDE']). We make the points all red using color_discrete_sequence (which allows us to select a discrete set of colors rather than using a spectrum) because the regression line is going to be, by default, blue. We make the facet rows Relative Height, which will separate the points into a 'Low' and 'High' scatterplot, and finally, we add our title.\nThen, once the graph is created, we first increase the height, and then we create a dictionary called altitude_dict whose keys are 2 and 1, and whose values are a list containing the words 'Low' or 'High' and elev_below_center or elev_above_center. It will become apparent why we do this when we apply facet specific changes. But first, we call fig.layout.annotations which allows us to change the label on the right-hand side that indicates what detemrines our facets. The 0th annotation will be for the High graph (which is on the bottom), and we clarify where the center referenced in ‘Distance from Center’ (i.e., elev_below_center or elev_above_center) is, and likewise, the 1st will be for the Low graph (which is on top). The reason I do not do this in the body of the for loop below is because editing layout.annotations seems to affect all annotations on the graph, so I ordered it in this particular way because, otherwise, the equations that we print on our graph would also be affected by this.\n\n\nPart 4b(iv): Facet-Specific Changes\nThe last large step is to make a for loop which will help us add the regression line and equation information onto the graph. Once again, I had to look up the documentation for this as while I had done something similar in R’s ggplot2, I had no idea how to do this for plotly. See this link and search for add_trace for a similar example: https://plotly.com/python/creating-and-updating-figures/\nI create a for loop over the dictionary that we created earlier which will allow us to simultaneously keep an index for the facet rows (key) as well as pertinent information (value). Recall that altitude_dict is the following:\naltitude_dict = {2: ['Low',elev_below_center], 1:['High',elev_above_center]}\nAlright. We start by using .add_trace on our figure, which essentially allows us to print other objects on top of our existing graph (geoms in ggplot2 if you’re familiar), and the trace that we want to add is a line, which I found out that you can create using px.line (https://plotly.com/python-api-reference/generated/plotly.express.line). The syntax is pretty simple (see row above), though. For the x values, we look in coef_info. It’s worth inspecting the output of coef_info first to see why this actually works:\n\ndb_file = 'climate.db'\nmonth = 3\nyear_begin = 2015\nyear_end = 2020\nelev_below_center = 0\nelev_above_center = 2000\nradius = 200\nqueried_data = elevation_query(db_file,month, year_begin, year_end,\n                               elev_below_center, elev_above_center, radius)\nqueried_data['Diff from Last'] = queried_data.groupby(['NAME', 'LATITUDE'])['Temp'].diff().dropna().abs() #Query and difference data.  \nqueried_data['Relative Height'] = queried_data.groupby(['NAME','LATITUDE'])[['STNELEV']].transform(altitude_check, elev_below_center, radius)\nqueried_data['Distance from Center'] = queried_data.apply(relative_height_difference,\n  args = (elev_below_center, elev_above_center), axis = 1)  #Calculate distance from elev_below_center or elev_above_center  \ncoef_info = queried_data.dropna().groupby('Relative Height').apply(coef_elev)\nprint(coef_info, coef_info['High'][1])\n\nRelative Height\nHigh    ([[-198.5999999999999, 1.8781317057391695], [-...\nLow     ([[-59.1, 1.4440271474376656], [-56.4828282828...\ndtype: object [ 1.87803968e+00 -4.63365829e-07]\n\n\n/Users/ziongassner/anaconda3/lib/python3.11/site-packages/sklearn/base.py:439: UserWarning:\n\nX does not have valid feature names, but LinearRegression was fitted with feature names\n\n/Users/ziongassner/anaconda3/lib/python3.11/site-packages/sklearn/base.py:439: UserWarning:\n\nX does not have valid feature names, but LinearRegression was fitted with feature names\n\n\n\nWe see that the output of coef_info is sorted into the two groups High and Low, which is why we’re able to acccess the information regarding individual regressions using value[0] as it returns either of those exact keywords. Furthermore, because of the structure of our numpy array stored in coef_info, we’re capable of extracting the x and y coordinates using the standard subsetting operator. This is all we need for px.line, but before being able to add it as a trace, we need to append .data[0] to the end of px.line because otherwise, we’re actually going to be trying to grab the entirety of the line object and pass it to add_trace, when we only need the values contained within it. Finally, we can specify our row with key and column as 1 (recall that both are required even for one-dimensional faceting). Note that we use values 2 and 1 for key because we start by plotting the Low values on top (row 2) and then the High values below (row 1). This indexing does not start at zero! (This also took a lot of trial and error :( ).\nOnce we’ve added the line, though, all that’s left is the equation as text. We once again set xref and yref to paper as in the case of the histsograms, and we set x equal to -radius/2, which should ideally keep it at the 25th percentile of the chart. The height will have to depend on the distribution of the points–if some are extremely high up, there’s a chance that they might block the text. As such, we find the maximum value of Diff from Last for our particular group and add an extra 10 percent for good measure.\nThe text for the annotation looks complicated, but it’s mostly syntax that’s getting in the way. Our equation will be of the form \\(y = b_1+b_2x\\). \\(b_1\\) is simply the intercept term which we can find within the second item (1st index) of coef_info for our particular group as the item in the 0th index (hence the [1][0]), which is then rounded to 4 decimal places for ease of viewing. Adding the slope is a bit tricky because we don’t want to put a plus sign if the slope is a negative number since the minus sign will be printed by default, so we use Python’s ternary operator to print a plus sign if and only if the slope term (the item with the 1st index in the coefficient information part of coef_info), otherwise, we just leave it blank and let the minus sign of the coefficient take care of it. After this, we add the coefficient itself multiplied by x. Once again, we set showArrow = False to avoid creating any distractions for our labels, and we make sure to specify the right column and row using key.\nAnd then we’re done! We show the figure and also return queried_data if the user is interested in seeing the data up close.\nSo, what can we conclude from this? Let’s look at data from 1980 till 2020 for a few different months, and looking at 200 feet within sea level and 2000 feet:\n\nplot_1 = elevation_temp_plotter('climate.db', 4, 1980, 2020, 0, 2000, 200)\n\n/Users/ziongassner/anaconda3/lib/python3.11/site-packages/sklearn/base.py:439: UserWarning:\n\nX does not have valid feature names, but LinearRegression was fitted with feature names\n\n/Users/ziongassner/anaconda3/lib/python3.11/site-packages/sklearn/base.py:439: UserWarning:\n\nX does not have valid feature names, but LinearRegression was fitted with feature names\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot_2 = elevation_temp_plotter('climate.db', 8, 1980, 2020, 0, 2000, 200)\n\n/Users/ziongassner/anaconda3/lib/python3.11/site-packages/sklearn/base.py:439: UserWarning:\n\nX does not have valid feature names, but LinearRegression was fitted with feature names\n\n/Users/ziongassner/anaconda3/lib/python3.11/site-packages/sklearn/base.py:439: UserWarning:\n\nX does not have valid feature names, but LinearRegression was fitted with feature names\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot_3 = elevation_temp_plotter('climate.db', 8, 1980, 2020, 0, 2000, 200)\n\n/Users/ziongassner/anaconda3/lib/python3.11/site-packages/sklearn/base.py:439: UserWarning:\n\nX does not have valid feature names, but LinearRegression was fitted with feature names\n\n/Users/ziongassner/anaconda3/lib/python3.11/site-packages/sklearn/base.py:439: UserWarning:\n\nX does not have valid feature names, but LinearRegression was fitted with feature names\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn all three cases, the interesting part is that the y-intercept term increase between the Low and High altitudes, but the slope decreases. This suggests that elevation might actually have a positive relationship with temperature volatility (since the intercept term for the second graph encapsulates the effect of the first ~1800 feet and because the slope starts out positive), but the effect of higher altitudes on volatility may diminish, as evidenced by the lower slopes in the second example."

Many species exhibit what’s known as sexual dimorphism, wherein members of one sex have markedly distinct features from those of another. It wouldn’t necessarily be surprising to see, for example, females and males from one species to have a different average mass.\nHowever, it would be interesting to know if bodily proportions differ between sexes. For instance, males of one species might be larger and heavier than females, but if their bodies are of similar shape, then one would simply appear to be a smaller version of the other.\nTo this end, let’s compare the length of each penguin’s flipper to the length of it’s culmen. If you’re wondering what a culmen is, by the way…\n\n\n\nCredit to Allison Horst and Dr. Kristen Gorman on Twitter\n\n\nWe’ll start by eliminating any columns that we don’t want. For our purposes, we just want the Species (since proportions probably differ from one to the next), Stage (since at different points in their lifespan, penguins might have different shapes) Culmen Length (mm), Flipper Length (mm), and Sex.\n\npenguins3 = penguins2[['Species', 'Stage', 'Culmen Length (mm)', 'Flipper Length (mm)', 'Sex']] #Select the columns we want\npenguins3.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies\nStage\nCulmen Length (mm)\nFlipper Length (mm)\nSex\n\n\n\n\n1\nAdelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)\nAdult, 1 Egg Stage\n39.5\n186.0\nFEMALE\n\n\n2\nAdelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)\nAdult, 1 Egg Stage\n40.3\n195.0\nFEMALE\n\n\n4\nAdelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)\nAdult, 1 Egg Stage\n36.7\n193.0\nFEMALE\n\n\n5\nAdelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)\nAdult, 1 Egg Stage\n39.3\n190.0\nMALE\n\n\n6\nAdelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)\nAdult, 1 Egg Stage\n38.9\n181.0\nFEMALE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nset(penguins3['Stage']) #Coercing something into a sit displays its unique values.\n\n{'Adult, 1 Egg Stage'}\n\n\n\nset(penguins3['Species'])\n\n{'Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)',\n 'Chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica)',\n 'Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua)'}\n\n\nWe see that we have three distinct species of penguin, but only one stage (the 1 egg stage of adulthood), so we can eliminate this column.\n\npenguins3.columns\n\nIndex(['Species', 'Stage', 'Culmen Length (mm)', 'Flipper Length (mm)', 'Sex'], dtype='object')\n\n\n\npenguins3 = penguins3.drop('Stage', axis = 1)\n\nOkay, now we need to create a new column that contains the ratio of the flipper length to the culmen length.\n\npenguins3['Flipper-Culmen Ratio'] =  penguins3['Flipper Length (mm)'] / penguins3['Culmen Length (mm)']\n\n\npenguins3.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies\nCulmen Length (mm)\nFlipper Length (mm)\nSex\nFlipper-Culmen Ratio\n\n\n\n\n1\nAdelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)\n39.5\n186.0\nFEMALE\n4.708861\n\n\n2\nAdelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)\n40.3\n195.0\nFEMALE\n4.838710\n\n\n4\nAdelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)\n36.7\n193.0\nFEMALE\n5.258856\n\n\n5\nAdelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)\n39.3\n190.0\nMALE\n4.834606\n\n\n6\nAdelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)\n38.9\n181.0\nFEMALE\n4.652956\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualization\nNow that we have all of our column names in order, let us visualize our data properly.

We’re going to first make an array of two empty plots, and then we’ll fill them with nearly identical histograms except for the fact that one contains the male data and the other the female data.\n\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=2, figsize=(10, 5)) #Because we have a 1-d grid of plots, axes will have a 1-d index\naxes[0].hist(adelie_male['Flipper-Culmen Ratio'], bins=10, edgecolor='black', color='red') #10 bins is probably fine if we have ~70 observations\naxes[0].set_title('Male Flipper-Culmen Ratio') #axes[0] refers to the first (left-most) graph\naxes[0].set_xlabel('Ratio')\naxes[0].set_ylabel('Frequency')\n\n\naxes[1].hist(adelie_female['Flipper-Culmen Ratio'], bins=10, edgecolor='black', color='green')\naxes[1].set_title('Female Flipper-Culmen Ratio')\naxes[1].set_xlabel('Ratio')\naxes[1].set_ylabel('Frequency')\n\nText(0, 0.5, 'Frequency')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that there may be somewhat of a difference–on average, the ratio for male penguins is lower than that of female ones. We can compare them side by side by using a box-plot.

We’re going to have to import the seaborn package, which interacts very well with matplotlib. (Thanks professor for demonstrating sns with lineplots in class!). For the documentation for boxplots, see the link below, but the syntax is quite simple as we just need to specify different groups (x), our variable of interest (y), and one more differentiation in the color (hue, which we set equal to sex):\nhttps://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.boxplot.html\n\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n\nplt.figure()\nsns.boxplot(x='Species', y='Flipper-Culmen Ratio', hue='Sex', data=penguins3)\n\nplt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='center', fontsize = 7) #Needed because otherwise the names go on top of each other.\nplt.title('Ratio of Flipper to Culmen Length of Male and Female Penguins')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndeed, for all of the species, it seems as if, on average, females have a greater flipper length to culmen length ratio. Wouldn’t it be great, though, if we could place some of those summary statistics that we saw earlier onto the plot itself?\n\npenguin_summary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncount\nmin\n25%\n50%\n75%\nmax\n\n\nSpecies\nSex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)\nFEMALE\n71.0\n4.27\n4.86\n5.09\n5.29\n5.86\n\n\nMALE\n68.0\n4.19\n4.61\n4.75\n4.94\n5.72\n\n\nChinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica)\nFEMALE\n34.0\n3.12\n4.04\n4.14\n4.26\n4.64\n\n\nMALE\n33.0\n3.63\n3.81\n3.91\n3.98\n4.33\n\n\nGentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua)\nFEMALE\n58.0\n4.19\n4.54\n4.66\n4.80\n5.23\n\n\nMALE\n60.0\n3.86\n4.37\n4.48\n4.60\n4.93\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can use the plt.text() function to help us. I didn’t learn about this in PIC16A, but the syntax is very simple (see below for documentation). We need an x coordinate, a y coordinate, the text itself, and a color. The y coordinate is easily visible on our graph, but the x isn’t necessarily. In our case, the boxplots are centered around 0, 1, and 2. Below, for instance, is a plot where we show the median value of the ratio for female Chinstrap penguins.\n\nplt.figure()\nsns.boxplot(x='Species', y='Flipper-Culmen Ratio', hue='Sex', data=penguins3)\nplt.text(.7,4.14,'4.14', color = 'red') #x coordinate, y coordinate, text, color\nplt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='center', fontsize = 7) #Needed because otherwise the names go on top of each other.\nplt.title('Ratio of Flipper to Culmen Length of Male and Female Penguins')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can thus use a loop to do this for every single summary statistic for every single box plot. Let’s start by making a modified version of the summary table without the count variable:\n\npenguin_summary_mod = penguin_summary.drop(\"count\", axis=1)\npenguin_summary_mod\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmin\n25%\n50%\n75%\nmax\n\n\nSpecies\nSex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)\nFEMALE\n4.27\n4.86\n5.09\n5.29\n5.86\n\n\nMALE\n4.19\n4.61\n4.75\n4.94\n5.72\n\n\nChinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica)\nFEMALE\n3.12\n4.04\n4.14\n4.26\n4.64\n\n\nMALE\n3.63\n3.81\n3.91\n3.98\n4.33\n\n\nGentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua)\nFEMALE\n4.19\n4.54\n4.66\n4.80\n5.23\n\n\nMALE\n3.86\n4.37\n4.48\n4.60\n4.93\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo use a loop, we need to make use of the .iloc method provided to Pandas data frames, which allows us to select the at a specific point in a table. We see above that penguin_summary_mod has 6 rows (6 species-sex combinations) and 5 columns (5 summary statistics). The first coordinate in iloc is the row index and the second is the column index.\nWe need to more explicitly set x coordinates due to the positioning of the box plots on the graph. Both the text and the y coordinates should correspond to the value of the summary statistic.\n\n\nplt.figure() #This delimits the end of the last figure and the beginning of this one\n\nbox = sns.boxplot(x='Species', y='Flipper-Culmen Ratio', hue='Sex',width = .7, data=penguins3 ) #I set width to .7 to make the boxes slightly skinnier\nx_coords = [-.25,0.1,.75,1.1,1.75,2.1] #By experimenting, I was able to see that an offset of -.25 and +.1, respectively, centered the text.\nfor i in range(6): #Iterates through the 6 x coordinates\n    for j in range(5): #Iterates through the 5 columns of penguin_summary_mod\n        plt.text(x_coords[i],penguin_summary_mod.iloc[i,j]+.02,penguin_summary_mod.iloc[i,j], color = 'lightgreen', fontsize = 8) #I add .02 so that the text does not intersect the whiskers/edges.\nbox.set_facecolor('gray')\nplt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='center', fontsize = 7) #Needed because otherwise the names go on top of each other.\nplt.title('Ratio of Flipper to Culmen Length of Male and Female Penguins')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter playing around with the functions and methods for a bit, I was able to come up with this chart, which I think looks pretty nice.\n\n\nThanks for looking at my post :3\n\n\n\nPusheen in the Tub"

    "text": "It’s natural to be interested in works created by certain artists, and movies are no exception–if there’s an actor or actress that you’re a fan of, there’s a good chance that you’ll like the other films that they’ve appeared in. There are websites, like https://www.themoviedb.org, that conveniently arrange all of that information, but it can be tedious for a human being to have to go through it page by page.\nThe internet, though, is made up of computers, and as such, has a structure to it that we can manipulate using computers. In particular, webpages are often designed with HTML–the ML of which means “markup language.” This means that websites are usually sorted into organized pieces of information that contain different markers, called tags, that signal what they’re used for. HTML tags are of the form &lt;tag&gt; ... &lt;/tag&gt;, where the information within the dots could be text, link, other tags, or much more things.\nBy using a technique called web scraping, we can sift through web pages to search for specific tags and grab whatever information we want. To do this, we’re going to use a framework called scrapy that’s written in Python, but we won’t really be using a jupyter notebook as we have been previous. Rather, we’ll be editing files directly that use Python syntax but have a lot of machinery under the hood. The purpose of this post is not to meticulously detail every aspect of scrapy–I would have no idea how to do that–but rather to introduce some of its web scraping capabilities so that you can carry out something like this yourself.\nWe are going to be scraping the aforementioned website https://www.themoviedb.org, but before we get to that, let’s go over how to set up scrapy."

Another folder also with the name TMDB_scraper\nWe’ll return to scrapy.cfg in a bit–it contains some more general configurations for how scrapy works on our system. For now, though, open TMDB_scraper.\nInside of this folder, you should see something like the following:\n\n\n\nImage 1\n\n\nWe will be returning to settings.py later. The other .py files are not going to be explored for the purposes of this exercise, but more advanced web-scraping projects will require you to edit them.\nFor now, open the folder called spiders. This is where we will manipulate our spider–which we can think of a little “device” that we set up to crawl through our website. It’s what does the scraping for us, and it’s where we’ll have to do most of the coding.\nYou will be greeted by a file called __init__.py. Open it using the program of your choice. I always use Xcode.\nThis should file should be blank besides a comment that is generated by default. Please paste the following into the file (generated by Professor Ko). Below, I’ll explain what the code means, and how we’re going to use it:\n# to run \n# scrapy crawl tmdb_spider -o movies.csv -a subdir=137113-edge-of-tomorrow\n\nimport scrapy\n\nclass TmdbSpider(scrapy.Spider):\n    name = 'tmdb_spider'\n    def __init__(self, subdir=None, *args, **kwargs):\n        self.start_urls = [f\"https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/{subdir}/\"]\n        \ndef parse(self, response):\n    yield None\n\ndef parse_full_credits(self, response):\n    yield None\n\ndef parse_actor_page(self, response):\n    yield None\nparse, parse_full_credits, and parse_actor_page yield None as a placeholder. We’ll add to the bodies of these functions later.\nSince our environment already has scrapy, we should be able to import it without any issue.\nFirst of all, note that we have to declare a class in order for our spider to exist. The name of the class can be whatever you want, but here, I name it TmdbSpider. The class only takes one input, namely, scrapy.Spider. In the body of the class, we define a class variable called name, which will determine the name of the spider which we will use when calling it in the command line, so make sure to give it a name that makes sense! Here, I use tmdb_spider.\nThen, for the initialization, besides the mandatory parameter self (recall from PIC16A), we include the argument subdir which by default, we set to None and also allow for additional arguments. We will pass arguments into the spider via the command line. Within the initialization, we have to declare an instance variable called start_urls which is a list of one string, in our case. The element of this list determines what site our spider will start on. I say start on, because by crawling through a website, it can effectively “click” on other links on the page. Here, we declare an f string that takes us to the page of a given movie on themoviedb website. After /movie/, each film has its own unique extension which is precisely what the argument subdir determines. My favorite movie is the action film Edge of Tomorrow starring Tom Cruise, so we’ll be using that for the purposes of this blog. You can pick whatever movie you’d like, but make sure to use the appropriate subdir.\nA method specifically named parse is required in order for our spider to work. Before we get to that, though, it’s important to understand on a conceptual level what we want our spider to do:"

    "title": "Getting Your Favorite Movies: Using Scrapy to Crawl through the Web",
    "section": "Specifications",
    "text": "Specifications\nBefore giving an outline of what we want our spider to do, we should clarify what we want the final output to be. It would be convenient for us to return a .csv file containing each actor’s name and the name of the movie they’ve been in for each entry. The part where we generate the .csv will actually be done in the command line for us–all we need to do with our spider is to generate a dictionary that corresponds to the entries, where the keys are the name of the columns. Hence, we’ll want one for the actor’s name, and one for the name of the movie.\nOkay, let’s inspect the HTML source code of our pages. Note that we’ll start with the “cast” page since all we need to do to get here from the movie page is just by adding cast to the URL. Thus, we won’t actually need to have the spider interact with the movie page itself.\n\n\n\nImage 5\n\n\nOkay, what’s going on here? Remember, tags in HTML are always enclosed in something like &lt;tag&gt;...&lt;/tag&gt;, and a webpage will usually nest lots of tags inside of each other.\nWe see that there is an &lt;ol&gt; tag–which stands for ordered list–of class people credits. &lt;ol&gt; is a tag built into HTML, whereas people credits is just one class of ol among others that exist on the website. If you see on the left-hand side, we can access this with ol.people.credits. Now, just letting you know ahead of time, we can essentially make our spider retrieve content that exists under certain headings, which is why we want to keep track of what sort of tags and classes are relevant for us.\nThen, within the &lt;ol&gt;, we see that we have a bunch of &lt;li&gt; tags, which stands for list item. Let’s look in more detail at the first one (which is opened up in the above image).\n\n\n\nImage 6\n\n\nEverything between the underlined &lt;li&gt; and &lt;/li&gt; is contained within the list element. We see that there are several tags within. One type is called &lt;div&gt;, which stands for division. This divides &lt;li&gt; into different sections. There is another tag called &lt;a&gt;, which contains a link. See how there’s two different ones? The one at the top, which has a &lt;div&gt; tag within it, is a link embedded into the photo of Tom Cruise. The other one is a link embedded into the text that shows his name (highlighted on the left-hand side of the screen).\nWe can see what page the link takes us to by looking at the href attribute of the &lt;a&gt; tag. You can imagine this to be like a sort of “class variable” for &lt;a&gt;. href actually shows what page the link will take us to. In our case, we see that, in both cases, we get taken to the same page: /person/500-tom-cruise/. Note that this is a subdirectory that we’d have to append onto our URL.\nThough both links take us to the same page, we’ll be using the second instance for two reasons. One, it contains less information within it (no images), and two, we can also grab the name of the actor. See how after the href link we simply see the text Tom Cruise? We can grab the actor name from there.\nNow, let’s see what we need from the actor page:\n\n\n\nImage 7\n\n\nSo, what do we see here? There’s a &lt;section&gt; of class full_wrapper_credits. This will contain the different movies that the actor has been cast in. Within full_wrapper_credits is a &lt;div&gt; of class credits_list. On each actor’s page, though, it doesn’t just show what movie’s they’ve acted in, but also, what movie’s they’ve produced or have been a non-acting crew member in. We see this in that within div.credits.list are different &lt;tables&gt; of class card credits. The one at the very top is unlabeled and contains the movies they’ve acted in, but if we see below, there are others with an &lt;h3&gt; (header 3) text entry right before, “Production” and “Crew”.\nThat means that we have to be careful! We don’t want to select a movie if our favorite actor didn’t actually play in it. Let’s look inside of the table now:\n\n\n\nImage 8\n\n\nSimilarly to the &lt;ol&gt;, the table is filled with instances of &lt;tr&gt;–table rows. Each &lt;tr&gt; contains, among other things, another table of class credit_group, if we open this even further, we get:\n\n\n\nImage 9\n\n\n&lt;td&gt; (table data) tags, which contains an &lt;a&gt; (remember, a link) to the movie in question, and within the link is the text that has the movie name which is inside of a &lt;bdi&gt;, which stands for bidirectional isolate. I’m not really sure what that means, but it stores text, and this is the text that we’re interested in order to get the movie name."

Another rule of thumb (whose justification I’ll explain) is that, every time we follow a new link, we need to create a new method for our spider. So, we start on the movie page, go to the cast page, and then go to the actor’s page. Hence, we’ll need 3 different methods which correspond to the (currently blank) ones that you should have in your tmdb_spider.py file."

    "text": "Additional Tweaks\nThere are a few essential things that we should go over before sstarting to play around with our spider, even though we could technically get started right now.\n\nscrapy shell\nAs it stands, the only way we’re able to test our spider is by imputting commands into our terminal. This makes debugging quite difficult. In order to help with this, it’s recommended that you use the scrapy shell:\nhttps://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/shell.html\nThis should be easy to set up if you are working in an envrionment with IPython installed. All you need to do is go to the scrapy.cfg file (which is in the highest level directory within your project folder) and enter the following:\n[settings]\nshell = ipython\nWhen you start of the command prompt, this will actually let you simultaneously run scrapy commands while also using it as a Python console, meaning that you can write code.\n\n\nUser Agent\nWebsites don’t necessarily like bots on their pages collecting their data all of the time, especially because it can cause a lot of traffic to be directed to a site at once. To mitigate this, many websites have measures that attempt to remove spiders. For example, there is a document called robots.txt that contains information about what webscrapers can and can’t access. By default, there is a line in the settings.py file that displays the following:\nROBOTSTXT_OBEY = True\nIt’s important to obey robots.txt, so we’ll be keeping this as-is. However, when I first tried to run my scraper, it didn’t work because I kept getting 403 (access forbidden) errors because the site wasn’t happy about my spider. In order to get around this, we need to mimic a human being on the website. To do so, open settings.py and paste the following:\nUSER_AGENT = 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/97.0.4692.71 Safari/537.36'\nI’m not an expert on this, but essentially, the information in USER_AGENT is sent to the website when accessing it, and if we use the USER_AGENT argument to mimic a web browser (I found the above information online), then a website is much more likely to let us through. In my case (and with this website), this solves the issue. Stay in settings.py for the next section!\n\n\nPage Limit\nWhile debugging, we don’t want to run extremely long requests since they take time. It’s generally good practice to limit the number of pages that your spider can scrape while you’re still testing it out. In settings.py, paste the following line:\nCLOSESPIDER_PAGECOUNT = 20\nThis instructs the spider to terminate its scraping after having visited 20 pages, which is a decent number to start out with, even if (according to the implementation of our spider) we should be visiting more.\nOnce you’re ready to test your final version, make sure to remove this line!"

Thus, the completed version of parse should then be:\n\ndef parse(self, response):\n    \"\"\"\n    Initial parse method for class ```TMdbSpider``\n    Assumes valid ``subdir`` argument from initialization.\n    Sends spider to crawl ``cast_url`` (movie's cast page).\n    Yields `scrapy.Request` using `parse_full_credits\n    \"\"\"\n    cast_url = self.start_urls[0] + \"cast\"\n    yield scrapy.Request(cast_url, callback = self.parse_full_credits)\nThe string cast_url simply refers to the step of adding the cast to the end of our movie page’s URL in order to access the cast page. The next line is more complicated. Recall from PIC16A that, for generators, yield acts as a sort of partial return statement that lets the function continue running. When it comes to a scrapy spider, we use yield when we want to jump to another page. We do this by calling the function scrapy.Request, which, for our purposes, has two crucial arguments. One is the url (which we set to cast_url), and the other is called callback. Since yield effectively lets us ‘exit’ the function, we need to specify what method we’re using to crawl through the linked url, which will be the next method, parse_full_credits\nUpon completing this yield, our spider will then go to the cast page for the actor and access its HTML source code, just like we did when inspecting the page. This is why we need 3 different methods: each page has a different source code, so when we Request something from a new page, we’re looking at something new!"

    "text": "Method 2: parse_full_credits\n\nStep 2: Iterate through the &lt;li&gt;’s of an &lt;ol&gt;.\nOkay, so now that our spider is on the page cast_url, we need to tell it what to do on that page, and because of our callback argument, we’re going to need to write code for the parse_full_credits method.\nSo, remember that the first thing that we wanted our spider to do was to inspect the &lt;ol&gt; of class people credits. If you go to the page in question, we will see that these are properly kept as ol.people.credits. There’s one other caveat. We have to make sure that we’re only grabbing actors and not any other crew members. Luckily, the credits for crew members are stored in a class called ol.people.credits.crew, but if we were to just specify ol.people.credits in our code, scrapy will only check whether or not that tag/class is contained in the class that it’s inspecting, not if they’re identical. So, to navigate to just hte normal ol.people.credits, we need our spider to go to ol.people.credits:not(.crew). Furthermore, we don’t want our spider to grab every single piece of information within the ol, but rather, each of the lis. To specify that we’re looking for a tag witihn a tag, we put a space after our query and type the name of the tag we’re interested in. Hence, we want our spider to go to ol.people.credits:not(.crew) li, for each li. Finally, remember how there were 2 different links inside of each li, but we only wanted one of them? The one that wasn’t stored with the actor’s photo was in a &lt;div&gt; of class info. So, our final “query” is going to be ol.people.credits:not(.crew) li div.info\nAlright, how do we actually do this? This involves using the response parameter from earlier. Recall that response is the HTML source code. By using the .css method, we can essentially sort through the page’s CSS code to convert what’s on the page into something that tmdb_spider.py can process. Hence, for now, write the following:\ndef parse_full_credits(self, response): \n    actor_list = response.css(\"ol.people.credits:not(.crew) li div.info\")\nOne very nice thing about the way .css works is that our spider will automatically grab every instance of li that matches the above criteria. We don’t have to worry about any sort of iteration at this point. In fact, the return value, which we store as actor_list is an iterator that we can use with a for loop! Note that anything inside of .css must be a string.\n\n\nStep 3: For each &lt;li&gt;\n\nStore the actor’s name from the &lt;a&gt; in each &lt;li&gt;.\nRecall that the both the actor’s name and the link to their page is stored within each &lt;li&gt;. Thus, we can make our for loop as such:\ndef parse_full_credits(self, response): \n    actor_list = response.css(\"ol.people.credits:not(.crew) li div.info\")\n    for actor_li in actor_list:\n        actor_name = actor_li.css(\"a::text\").get()\nSince actor_list is an iterator, we can call its individual elements actor_li, which is still a piece of HTML source code that we’ve placed locally into our program. So, once again, we inspect the &lt;li&gt;’s CSS code by using .css. In particular, recall that links are stored in a tag called &lt;a&gt;, but &lt;a&gt;’s contain multiple parts that aren’t necessarily subtags. In these cases, we use the double colon operator :: to grab specific parts of the tag. The name of the actor, if you go back to the screenshot above, was not kept in any sort of specific attribute. Rather, it was just placed in the body of &lt;a&gt;. We can access it by calling a::text. To convert that text into a Python string, however, we need to use the .get() method, which we then assign to actor_name.\nOne tricky bit here, by the way, is that while response.css grabs every instance of the specified tag, .get() will only place the first instance of what’s found into a Python object. This doesn’t matter in this specific instance, but it’s important to know. You would have to use .getall() otherwise.\n\n\nFollow the link to the actor’s page\nThe completed for loop below is longer than you might be expecting:\ndef parse_full_credits(self, response): \n    \"\"\"\n    Second parse method for class ``TMdbSpider``\n    Called from `parse`. Assumes valid ``cast_url``\n    Fetches links to all actors' pages from cast page:\n    An ordered list `ol` of class `people credits` contains\n    `li` list elements with `div` elements of class `info`.\n    Each `li` stores the link to the actor's page and the\n    actor's name in an `a` tag.\n    Stores name of each actor in ``actor_name``.\n    Yields `scrapy.Request` using `self.parse_actor_page`. Passes ``actor_name``\n    \"\"\"\n    actor_list = response.css(\"ol.people.credits:not(.crew) li div.info\")\n    for actor_li in actor_list:\n        actor_link = actor_li.css(\"a::attr(href)\").get()\n        actor_name = actor_li.css(\"a::text\").get()\n        if actor_link:\n            actor_link = response.urljoin(actor_link)\n            yield scrapy.Request(actor_link, callback=self.parse_actor_page, meta = {\"actor\": actor_name})\nIn addition to grabbing the actor’s name, as we just did, we also grab the link and store it as a string in actor_link, once again using .get(). This time, href is stored as an attribute of &lt;a&gt; (note that it’s in pink when we inspect the page), so we use a::attr(href). If you remember from earlier, though, what’s stored inside of href is not the full URL, it’s just a subdirectory on https://www.themoviedb.org. We then have a conditional statement if actor_link. Recall that actor_link is a string. We want to make sure to stop here if we’ve gotten to the last actor on the page, so if there’s no one left, actor_link will simply be set to None. If we do have a link present, however, we can easily convert it to the full URL, however, by using the .urljoin method of response. This takes the root of the response webpage and simply adds whatever subdirectory is specified.\nSince we’re going to be navigating to another page, we’re going to have to call scrapy.Request again. The next URL is actor_link, our last method will be parse_actor_page, but we also pass in a dictionary called meta with key actor and value actor_name. Parse methods in scrapy have the ability to allow for optional arguments (**kwargs) which we need if we want to pass the actor’s name from this method to the next one. To find out about this, I read this page. Search for “meta”:\nhttps://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/request-response.html\nNote that we can’t just declare a new instance variable called actor_name or something like that. This ends up breaking the code."

    "text": "Method 3: parse_actor_page\nNow we’re onto the last page, and the last method!\n\nStep 4: Isolate the correct &lt;table&gt; of class card credits\nJust like we did with the &lt;ol&gt; in the previous method, we’re going to use response.css to grab the card credits table that has the acting appearances and store it as an iterator that we will extract individual movies from. But remember what we said earlier? We only want to grab the first table of this type, so we’re going to be using a single colon with :first-of-type (thank you Professor Ko for helping me with this!). and grab all of the tooltip classes of &lt;a&gt;, which are precisely the actor names (see images from the previous part:\ndef parse_actor_page(self, response):\n    movie_list = response.css(\"div.credits_list table.card.credits:first-of-type a.tooltip\")\n…Except this doesn’t completely work. The problem (which I discovered when testing my submission for this assignment) is that there are some actors for whom the table that shows the movies in which they’ve acted is not the first. This seems to happen when someone is primarily known as a crew member but has also made appearances in movies–the works in which they’ve been a crew member appear at the top.\nThere is, however, a fix. Look at the image below:\n\n\n\nImage 10\n\n\nEach of the tables is preceded by a tag &lt;h3&gt; (which is a sort of header) that acts as a label. In our case, we want the table that follows the &lt;h3&gt; tag with text “Acting.” How do we do this? I wasn’t very sure because up until now, all we’ve had to do is filter within certain tags–I had to figure out how to access items based on surrounding tags.\nI’m not sure if this is possible using the .css method, but I did find that through xpath, this is possible via this StackOverflow post:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/65271036/python-scrapy-selector-for-text-elements-between-tags\nxpath is a language designed to parse through xml documents, which is similar to HTML. I’m not exactly how XML differs from HTML, nor do I know about how compatible they are. What I do know is that we can use it with Scrapy, and there is documentation about this on scrapy’s selector page:\nhttps://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/selectors.html#scrapy.selector.Selector\nI was able to get a grasp on how to use it from both the StackOverflow post, the site below, and the blog post below:\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_syntax.asp https://www.guru99.com/using-contains-sbiling-ancestor-to-find-element-in-selenium.html\nThe command we need to input is the following:\nacting_table = response.xpath(\"//h3[contains(text(), 'Acting')]/following-sibling::table[@class='card credits'][1]\")\n movie_list = acting_table.css(\"a.tooltip\")\nresponse.xpath is used when we want to use XPath instead of HTML. The double slash // is similar to typing the name of a tag with .css. What follows is the name of the tag that we’re interested in, so in our case, we use h3. The brackets are used to place some sort of function inside. We use one called contains which is a sort of filtering function which, for our purposes, takes two arguments. The first lets us know what kind of item we’re looking for, in our case, text(), and the second is the thing itself we want, namely, Acting. So, once we wrap this up, we get all &lt;h3&gt;s such that they contain the word Acting.\nBut, remember, that’s not what we want. We want the table of class card credits that follows the table. This is where we really need xpath, because we get to use something called following-sibling. First, though, we have to put a single slash /. This is what’s used to select from a prior node (whereas the double slash is used to select everything corresponding to a specific tag). following-sibling can be used to select items that are siblings “on the same level,” in a certain sense. Notice how the &lt;table&gt;‘s are interlaced by the &lt;h3&gt;’s–one isn’t a subtag of the other, so they’re siblings! According to the syntax, we have to specify what kind of tag we want with the double colon operator, so ::table, and then we specify the class within brackets with @class = 'card credits'. We put a [1] at the end (xpath indexing sadly starts from 1) to specify that we only want the first of such tables (since otherwise we’d be grabbing all of them that following ’Acting’.\nThen I return back to CSS just to be more comfortable. We grab all of the tooltips in &lt;a&gt; to get the movie names.\n\nGrab the text stored in &lt;bdi&gt;\nNow, like we did earlier, we need to create a for loop. Recall that the name of the movie that the actor has starred in is stored in a &lt;bdi&gt;, so we once again need to use the double colon operator with text in order to select the name. Finally, we use the .get() method to store it as a string.\ndef parse_actor_page(self, response):\nacting_table = response.xpath(\"//h3[contains(text(), 'Acting')]/following-sibling::table[@class='card credits'][1]\") \n        movie_list = acting_table.css(\"a.tooltip\")\n        for movie in movie_list:\n            movie_or_TV_name = movie.css(\"bdi::text\").get()\n\n\nReturn a dictionary containing the actor’s name and the movie name\nThis is the last step! We’ll actually do this in the body of a yield statement, which will signal to scrapy that this is the end (no more requests after this). Of course, by virtue of the fact that we’ve been using yields (and not returns) this whole time allows us to continue iterating in our for loop (we do, after all, technically have a nested for loop split across two methods).\nSee the code below:\n\ndef parse_actor_page(self, response):\n    \"\"\"\n    Final parse method for class ``TMdbSpider``\n    Called from `parse_full_credits`. Assumes valid ``actor_link`` and ``actor_name``\n    Fetches the name of each movie that an actor has been in from their page. Each\n    movie's name is in the text component of a `bdi` element on the page. The `bdi`\n    element is in a link (`a`) element of class `tooltip`.\n    Yields the actor's name and each movie/TV show's name as a dictionary with keys\n    \"actor\" and \"movie_or_TV_name\"\n    Actor name  takenfrom ``actor`` key in dict ``meta``, extracted from\n    `parse_full credits`.\n    \"\"\"\n    acting_table = response.xpath(\"//h3[contains(text(), 'Acting')]/following-sibling::table[@class='card credits'][1]\") #Grabs the first table following 'Acting'\n        movie_list = acting_table.css(\"a.tooltip\")\n        #Get only the films/shows they've appeared in, and grab their link tooltips\n        for movie in movie_list:\n            movie_or_TV_name = movie.css(\"bdi::text\").get() #Get the name in &lt;bdi&gt; from each movie\n            yield {\n            \"actor\" : response.meta.get(\"actor\"), #Actor name passed into function\n            \"movie_or_TV_name\" : movie_or_TV_name #From above result\n                }              \nmovie_or_TV_name was stored for us in the last step, but recall that we passed the actor name into parse_actor_page using kwargs**. Per the documentation, we have to use the method .meta.get() on the dictionary key in order to get its corresponding value (recall that we had meta = {\"actor\" : actor_name}).\nAnd then we’re done! Well, with making the spider, anyway."
